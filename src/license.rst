Licensing
=========

Open SoC Debug is licensed in a way which allows you to use, modify, and distribute OSD itself and products based on it without paying any royalties.
At the same time, The OSD Contributors do not give any warranty that it works as expected (or at all).
The legal details are layed out in the licenses that govern the individual parts of OSD.
Due to the different nature of code and documentation, we use different licenses.

.. note::
  Only the licenses and other legal documents itself are binding, this page only gives a human-readable and not legally binding overview.
  We cannot provide any legal advise if OSD is usable for your use case.
  Please speak to a lawyer in such cases.

Towards this goal, the software is generally licensed under the `MIT license <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_, while the hardware reference implementation carries the `Solderpad License <http://solderpad.org/licenses/>`_, a variant of the Apache 2.0 software license adjusted for hardware implementations.
